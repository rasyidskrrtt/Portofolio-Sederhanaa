                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Rasyid Iskandar Prayogi, my journey into the world of technology started when I was still in “SMK” vocational high school, where I studied Computer and Network Engineering.
                    Despite initially doubting my decision due to my prior education at a pesantren, which focused more on religious studies, I gradually developed a deep interest in IT.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I’ve honed my skills and found myself gravitating towards front-end web development, particularly due to its beginner-friendly nature and the creative flexibility it offers.
                    I’m passionate about improving user interfaces and crafting engaging digital experiences,
                    which I believe is essential in today’s tech-driven world.</p>
                <p>Outside of academics, I have a variety of hobbies, one of which is playing badminton. I'm inspired by top players like Jonathan Christie and "The Minions". Whether it’s on the court or in front of a computer,
                    I always approach challenges with enthusiasm and determination, eager to contribute to any team or project I am part of.</p>

                <h2>My Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently an undergraduate student of Information Systems at Singaperbangsa University in Karawang, Indonesia, where I have maintained a GPA of 3.75 out of 4.00 since October 2022. Previously,
                    I attended SMK Travina Prima in Bekasi, Indonesia, from March 2020 to April 2022, specializing in Computer and Network Engineering. My educational journey has given me a solid foundation in technology and information systems,
                    preparing me to face future challenges in the field.

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>During my internship at Dinas Kepemudaan & Olahraga (DISPORA) in Bekasi, Indonesia from March 2021 to May 2021, I was engaged in a diverse range of archival and administrative duties.
                    My primary responsibilities involved the identification and classification of inactive archives, meticulous data entry, and systematic storage and archiving.
                    I also played a crucial role in drafting official invitations for program events and regularly reported to the head of the department. This experience honed my organizational and clerical skills,
                    providing a solid foundation in managing detailed administrative tasks effectively under tight deadlines.</p>
                <p>In addition to my archival duties, my role required extensive interaction with various departmental teams to ensure the accuracy and security of the archived data.
                    This collaborative environment helped me develop a keen understanding of the importance of data integrity and the complexities involved in maintaining comprehensive archival systems.
                    My proactive approach and attention to detail were instrumental in the smooth operation of the archival department, contributing significantly to the efficiency of our data management systems.</p>
                <p>Following my internship at DISPORA, I furthered my technical skills at PT. Bakrie Autoparts in Indonesia in April 2022, where I specialized in Network Administration with a focus on Mikrotik systems.
                    I successfully completed the Competence Test in Mikrotik Configuration for Access Points and Bridges, achieving a score of 82 out of 100. This role involved configuring network solutions that optimized the efficiency and reliability of network operations,
                    showcasing my technical proficiency and my ability to adapt and apply my skills in practical, high-stakes environments.</p>
